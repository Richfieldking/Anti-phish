With the use of Genetic algorithms to determine patterns of phishing,
we use:

- Artificial Neural Network(ANN),
- Support Vector Machine(SVM) and
- Treefit Algorithm

    Use of rule based system formed by genetic algorithms

    how it works;

    Differentiating legimate links from phishing links, search of suspicious hyperlinks

    Evaluation of parameters with evaluation function, crossover, mutation. generation of pattern to match only phishing links using a specific ruleset.

    ## What is a rule based System?

    Its a logical program that uses predefined rules to make deductions and choices to perform automated actions .

    Use of human rules to store, sort and manipulate data with the mind of human intelligence using a lot of data sets.

    To enable rule based systems to update on its own and learn from their past mistakes, Ai or Machine learn follow and learn from the system. 

    ## Genetic Algorithms

    A family of computational models based on principles of evolution and natural selection.

    Algorithm converts the problem in a specific domain into a model by the use of chromosome-like data structure using selection, recombination, mutation operators.

    Genetic algorithm cycle

    Choose models(chromosomes):

    Attributes of the problem(encoding of different positions[genes] of each chromosome as bits, chars, numbers). 

    Evolution (at this stage, the set of chromosomes are called population

    Evaluations(function used to calculate goodness of each chromosome), Two operators, crossover, and mutation are used to simulate the natural reproduction and mutation species. The  selection of chromosomes for survival and combination is biased towards the fittest combination.
